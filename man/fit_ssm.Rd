\title{Fit Bayesian state-space models to animal movement data}
\usage{
fit_ssm(data, model = "DCRW", tstep = 1, adapt = 10000,
  samples = 5000, thin = 5, span = 0.2)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the following columns, "id","date",
"lc", "lon", "lat". "id" is a unique identifier for the tracking dataset.
"date" is the GMT date-time of each observation with the following format
"2001-11-13 07:59:59". "lc" is the Argos location quality class of each
observation, values in ascending order of quality are "Z", "B", "A", "0", "1",
"2", "3". "lon" is the observed longitude in decimal degrees. "lat" is the
observed latitude in decimal degrees. The Z-class locations are assumed to 
have the same error distributions as B-class locations.

Optionally, the input data.frame can specify the error standard deviations 
for longitude and latitude (in units of degrees) in the last 2 columns, 
named "lonerr" and "laterr", respectively. These errors are assumed to be
normally distributed. When specifying errors in the input data, all "lc" 
values must be equal to "G". This approach allows the models to be fit to 
data types other than Argos satellite data, e.g. geolocation data. See 
\code{\link{dat4jags}} for other options for specifying error parameters.

WARNING: there is no guarantee that invoking these options will yield sensible results!
For GPS data, similar models can be fit via the \code{moveHMM} package.}

\item{model}{name of state-space model to be fit to data. This can be one of 
"DCRW", "DCRWS", "hDCRW", or "hDCRWS"}

\item{tstep}{time step as fraction of a day, default is 1 (24 hours).}

\item{adapt}{number of samples during the adaptation and update (burn-in)
phase, adaptation and updates are fixed at adapt/2}

\item{samples}{number of posterior samples to generate after burn-in}

\item{thin}{amount of thinning of to be applied to the posterior samples to 
minimize within-chain sample autocorrelation}

\item{span}{parameter that controls the degree of smoothing by \code{stats::loess},
used to obtain initial values for the location states. Smaller values = less
smoothing. Values > 0.2 may be required for sparse datasets}
}
\value{
For DCRW and DCRWS models, a list is returned with each outer list
elements corresponding to each unique individual id in the input data
Within these outer elements are a "summary" data.frame of posterior mean and
median state estimates (locations or locations and behavioural states), the
name of the "model" fit, the "timestep" used, the input location "data", the
number of location state estimates ("N"), and the full set of "mcmc"
samples. For the hDCRW and hDCRWS models, a list is returned where results, etc are
combined amongst the individuals

\description{
Fits state-space models to animal tracking data. User can choose
between a first difference correlated random walk (DCRW) model, a switching 
model (DCRWS) for estimating location and behavioural states, and their 
hierarchical versions (hDCRW, hDCRWS). The models are structured for Argos
satellite data but options exist for fitting to other tracking data types.
}
\details{
The models are fit using JAGS 4.2.0 (Just Another Gibbs Sampler, created and
maintained by Martyn Plummer; http://martynplummer.wordpress.com/;
http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net). \code{fit_ssm} is a wrapper that first
calls \code{dat4jags}, which prepares the input data, then calls \code{ssm}
or \code{hssm}, which fit the specified state-space model to the data, 
returning a list of results.
